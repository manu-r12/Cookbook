# üìñ What I Learned

Working on Cookbook AI helped me enhance my skills in multiple areas of iOS development:

### MVVM Architecture
Implemented the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture for better code structure, separation of concerns, and maintainability. This architectural pattern improved how data flows between the UI and backend services.

### Enums for Clean Code
Used enums extensively to handle various states and cases throughout the application, making the codebase more organized, type-safe, and scalable.

### Unit and UI Testing
Implemented thorough testing for both individual components and the overall user interface. This includes writing unit tests for the business logic as well as UI tests to ensure a smooth user experience.

### Dependency Injection
Learned the best practices for managing dependencies in Swift, making the code more modular, testable, and easier to refactor.

### Asynchronous Programming with Swift's async/await
Utilized async/await patterns for making API calls and interacting with Firebase, improving code readability and error handling.

### SwiftUI
Built an intuitive and interactive UI using SwiftUI, including custom views and seamless animations to enhance user experience.
